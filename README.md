While the traditional 4Cs – Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat Weight – are widely recognized as key determinants of a diamond's quality and value, this study aims to investigate the true strength and importance of these factors in defining distinct clusters or groups of diamond. Leveraging a rich dataset, crawled from the web, with Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and International Gemological Institute (IGI) diamond grading characteristics, we analyzed the dataset thanks to data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to effectively reduce dimensionality while preserving maximal variance. As expected, we revealed the 4Cs' prominence across the first principal components. To discern natural groupings within the dataset, three distinct unsupervised clustering algorithms – K-means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative clustering – were applied. After evaluation of these algorithms using silhouette score, sum of squared error as internal validation metrics and of course visualization, the k-means algorithm yielded cohesive and well-separated clusters, leading us to use its results to understand the different characteristics of each cluster. This project builds upon previous research focused on price prediction by addressing the need for quality assessment in diamond evaluation. By leveraging clustering techniques, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of diamond characteristics and their impact on market value, thereby aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
